    <h1>The Amplification Paradox</h1>
    <div class="part part-1">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-block">In today's digital world, recommendation systems help connect users to content that matches
        their interests on social media and other platforms. However, there's an ongoing debate about how algorithms
        might promote extreme content and how that impacts users' content consumption. This blog post will help you
        understand the "amplification paradox" found in recommendation systems, which highlights the contradiction
        between algorithms exposing users to extreme content and studies showing that such content is rarely consumed,
        and when it is, it's not mainly through algorithmic recommendations.</p>
      <p class="text-block">Extreme content includes highly polarizing, controversial, or fringe material that goes
        beyond mainstream norms. Exposure to this type of content can cause several negative outcomes for users and
        society. For example, it can spread misinformation and conspiracy theories, damage trust in established
        institutions, and create divisions among people. Moreover, promoting extreme content can lead to the
        radicalization of individuals, pushing them towards more extreme beliefs and potentially harmful actions.</p>
      <p class="text-block">If the YouTube algorithm exposed users to extreme content, it would not only risk increasing
        these negative effects but also create an unhealthy online environment. Users could get stuck in echo chambers,
        where their existing beliefs are reinforced by the content they see, leading to further polarization and
        isolation from different perspectives.</p>
      <p class="text-block last-text-block">In this blog post, we'll explore the amplification paradox, shedding light
        on the potential risks of recommendation systems and their role in promoting extreme content. We'll also discuss
        the importance of understanding user behavior and preferences when creating and evaluating these systems. To
        help explain the topic more clearly, we'll include an animation that shows how agent-based models can help us
        understand the paradox. Our goal is to make this complex subject a bit easier for everyone to grasp, ensuring
        that the potential dangers of recommendation systems are recognized and handled responsibly.</p>
      <h2>The Agent-Based Model</h2>
      <p class="text-block">To explore the content recommended by recommendation systems, we developed an agent-based
        model. This model, which can be interpreted as a bot, selects videos from the suggestions provided by the
        recommender. We can configure this model to choose videos randomly or to mimic the way people pick videos. To
        accurately represent people's behavior, we introduce the term "relative utility," which represents the
        usefulness of each category to the user. Categories with low relative utility for a user will have a smaller
        chance of being selected by the model.</p>
      <p class="text-block last-text-block">In the interactive animation below, you can engage with the model and
        observe how it selects videos from the recommendations provided by the system. You can decide whether you want
        the model to pick videos randomly or based on utility. When set to random, all categories have an equal chance
        of being selected, whereas when set to utility, categories have varying chances of being selected depending on
        the user's preferences. You can see these probabilities in the bar chart below.</p>

        category grows or decreases when the model is interacting with the recommender system. First we will analyze how
        each category changes when the model is set to random selection, and then when it's set to selection based on
        utility.</p>
